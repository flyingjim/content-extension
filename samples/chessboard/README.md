Chessboard
==========

![Chessboard Widget in action](http://contentful.github.io/extensions/assets/chessboard.gif)

This extension uses [chessboard.js][] to display a chessboard that edits a JSON
field containing the position of the pieces.

To use the chessboard extension in the Contentful App you need to create a content
type with a `JSON Object` field. In the field settingsâ€™ `Appearance` tab you
then need to select the `Chessboard` extension.
