# Contentful Apps Launched!

In February 2020, Contentful [launched](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2020/02/25/contentful-app-framework-build-digital-experience-platform/) the next evolution of extensibility and integration with Contentful Apps. Existing Extensions are not going away, but we are recommending investing in Apps moving forward.

> Apps come with capabilities such as an installation screen, configuration and state management. They can be shared across your whole Contentful organization and across spaces, which simplifies maintenance and upgrades.

> While UI extensions are building blocks for customizing a single part of the Contentful web app, their application and ability to replicate integration across multiple spaces is limited. Taking this into consideration, we highly recommend customers  build and use apps going forward, as they will scale even as you integrate more services with Contentful. In addition, we will continue to release new features to apps.
